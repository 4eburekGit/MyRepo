<h2>You may have a mild depression!</h2>
<p>Although this test isn't enough to give you a diagnosis, I'd recommend consulting specialist. It's nothing bad about being a little depressed, but it can add up quickly and crush you with its weight. Have a good day and thanks for participating in testing. No results will be saved, so if you want, feel free to screenshot!</p>
<p class="mildt">Life is sure tough, but you mustn't give up!</p>
