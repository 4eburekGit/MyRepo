<h2>You have a moderate depression!</h2>
<p>Although this test isn't enough to give you a diagnosis, I'd recommend consulting specialist if you're feeling unwell. It's nothing bad about being depressed, life is surely tough, but it can add up quickly and crush you with its weight. Have a good day and thanks for participating in testing. No results will be saved, so if you want, feel free to screenshot!</p>
<p class="mildt">Stay cool and be yourself, don't let the life crush you!</p>
